    <p>Hi! My name is AnhTu Vothang, and I am in my third year of Computer Science (Honours) at Carleton University. I am seeking a 4- or 8-month co-op opportunity starting in May 2023.</p>
    <p>Prior to studying Computer Science, I studied Biomedical Sciences (French Immersion stream) at the University of Ottawa for two years. Why did I switch to Computer Science you may ask? Although I enjoy learning about biomedical sciences, I have always loved problem solving and developing things from scratch. Programming allows me to do those and it lets me demonstrate my creative thinking as well, whether it be through solving complex problems or designing web pages.</p>
    <p>I am proficient in Python, R, Java, JavaScript, C, HTML, and CSS, and I am currently learning C++ and Haskell in my courses. I am working on projects using PHP, React JS, and TypeScript through independent learning.</p>
    <p>I am currently working on a Movie Rating and Chatting Web Application in collaboration with two other students, an online art gallery, and  additional features for my portfolio website, such as making it a dark-mode and bilingual website. You can check out my other projects <u><a href="/projects.html">here</a></u> or visit my <u><a href="https://github.com/anhtuv">GitHub</a></u>!</p>
